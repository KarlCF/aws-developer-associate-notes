# AWS Developer Exam Notes

These are my notes while studying for the AWS Certified Developer Exam, I used the Stephane Mareek udemy course:
 <https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/>

The objective of writing along with the course and making it public is to help others learn and follow through the same content.

To do:

1. Review notes after finishing the course
2. Add links to segments and AWS Faqs links to each Service
3. Add notes after taking the practice exam and certification exam
